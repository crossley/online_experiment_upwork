- There is sometimes a variable delay between trials and
  between other events. I think this has to do with internet
  connection speed and the time it take to build a trials
  (i.e., load stimuli etc.). Can we get rid of these
  variable delays by building all trials in the beginning of
  the experiment? A progress bar displaying this process
  would be very helpful.
  
- We will also need a way to randomise the trial order of
  stimulus presentation. Loading everything in at the
  beginning and then performing a random shuffle is how I
  would normally do things. Can we do that here?
  
- On experiment finish, the code I get says ERROR. Perhaps
  this is because I am not running from mturk?

- Rather than write to a database on my website, can you
  recommend another option?
